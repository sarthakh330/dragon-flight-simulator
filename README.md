Dragon Flight Simulator is a browser-based 2D action game engineered with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

The game features real-time physics, adaptive difficulty, and responsive controls. All state is managed client-side, with persistent high scores via local storage. No external libraries or frameworks are used.
